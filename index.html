                <h2>What is green wood?</h2>
                <p>Green wood as the name implies is wood that is still &#8217;green&#8217; or freshly cut. Generally speaking, when working with green wood you start with wood straight from the log. Green wood has a high moisture content which makes it softer and easier to carve with. Freshly cut wood is considered to have a 100% moisture content and wood is considered green for 6-8 months if kept in log-form, with the bark on, and in a cool place.</p>

                <h2>What species are good for carving?</h2>
                <p>	Hardwood species are typically the best woods for carving. Hardwood trees are broadleaved deciduous trees and the UK has many native species that are great choices. <em>Silver birch</em>, <em>rowan</em> and <em>sycamore</em> are great all purpose hardwoods that can be used for many different projects and are readily available. <br><br> 
                    Fruit woods such as <em>apple</em>, <em>cherry</em> and <em>pear</em> often have pretty colours and patterns in it and is very dense. Although this makes it harder to carve it also gives a smooth finish . <em>Cherry</em> in particular is popular but is also prone to splitting when it dries so is not suitable for all projects.
