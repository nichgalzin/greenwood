                <h2>Where to start?</h2>
                <p>Wood carving is an ancient skill that can be very satisfying to master. It&#8217;s relatively inexpensive to start, requiring only a few basic tools and it can very therapeutic as well as a practical way to make many beautiful household objects. In the UK it&#8217;s luckily very easy to find a local group as in recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in traditional crafts.</p>
                <p>There are many amazing resources available online for those looking to start carving or to improve there existing skills- from numerous books to YouTube channels and websites (see the list in this section for some starting points). However learning in person and getting inspired by others is an invaluable experience for any budding craftsperson.</p>

                <h2>What is green wood?</h2>
                <p>Green wood as the name implies is wood that is still &#8217;green&#8217; or freshly cut down. Generally speaking, when working with green wood you start with wood straight from the log. Green wood has a high moisture content which makes it softer and easier to carve with. Freshly cut wood is considered to have a 100% moisture content and wood is considered green for 6-8 months if kept in log form, with the bark on, and in a cool place.</p>
                <p>Greenwood shrinks as it dries which can cause it to crack or warp, although the drying out process also makes the wood stronger and more durable. After you&#8217;re done carving any given object you need be careful with how you allow the piece to dry, in general the best advice is to do this a slowly as possible. Keep drying object away from heat sources and direct sunlight and takes steps to prolong the drying process, such as wrapping it in a damp towel or putting it in a bag of wood shavings.</p>

                <h2>What species are good for carving?</h2>
                <p>	Hardwood species are typically the best woods for carving. Hardwood trees are broadleaved deciduous trees and the UK has many native species that are great choices. <em>Silver birch</em>, <em>rowan</em> and <em>sycamore</em> are great all purpose hardwoods that can be used for many different projects and are readily available.</p>
                <p>Fruit woods such as <em>apple</em>, <em>cherry</em> and <em>pear</em> often have pretty colours and patterns in the grain and is very dense. Although this makes it harder to carve it also gives a smooth finish when carved. Cherry in particular is popular because of it beautiful colouring and pattern but is also prone to splitting when it dries so is not suitable for all projects.</p>

                <h2>Axe</h2>
                <p>Carving axes are a specialized tool made specifically for carving. They have a razor sharp and thin edge, unlike an axe used for splitting wood which is much thicker and has a wedge shape. A carving axes&#8217; edge grind can be done one of three ways left handed, right handed or centred.</p>
                <p>Left handed or right handed have one side of the edge, or bevel, flatter and the other a steeper angle. This allows for more aggressive cutting and is also good for using the axe when removing lots of waste wood and making flat surfaces. A centre ground axe can be used in either hand and is often a good choice for more detailed and precise work.</p>

                <h2>Sloyd Knife</h2>
                <p>Sloyd knifes are a Swedish designed tool that are widely used for carving. The blade length ranges from 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5cm) and has added thickness for strength. They are made of carbon steel and have a traditional Scandinavian grind which makes them easier to sharpen.</p>
                <p>Safety is always a concern when using a knife and carving is no different. Luckily there are many knife grips and carving techniques which will minimize and, with practice, nearly eliminate the chances of cutting yourself. When getting started make sure you take lots of breaks. Getting tired or losing focus will cause many little mistakes that could be otherwise prevented.</p>

                <h2>Hook knife</h2> 
                <p>	Also sometimes called a crook or spoon knife this a specialized tool with a curved blade is made for carving out hollows, for example the bowl of a spoon. They are made in left and right handed models and with various degrees of curves for cutting shallow or deep hollows. In general more shallow curved blades (such as the tool pictured) are meant for roughing out work. Tighter curved blades are better for fine details and finishing cuts, leaving a very smooth surface on the wood grain. See the links above for some good tips on different techniques for using a hook knife.</p>
